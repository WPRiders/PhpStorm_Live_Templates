# PhpStorm_Live_Templates
Live Templates for PhpStorm (jQuery, PHP ...)

# jQuery Live Templates
Added some of the most used jQuery snippets, some are modified specific for Wordpress.
<br/>On MAC you must press CMD+  J ( on windows CTRL + J ), in my case it’s a javascript template and it will only show up in a JS file. Start typing “jq” and a list of available snippets will show up.

# PHP - Wordpress Live Templates
Still gathering some of the most used code snippets. I will add the file as soon as i'll save some more.

# Install the templates
On OS X El Capitan  the XML files can be found at the following path <br/>
**/Users/<your_user>/Library/Preferences/PhpStorm<version_number>/templates/**
